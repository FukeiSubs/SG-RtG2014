## Timer Notes

I don't fully understand Japanese and in some cases I have to go for my personal preference of either splitting someone's sentence into multiple lines or having someone's interrupted sentence stay on a single line.
Please don't hesitate to adjust, split, concatenate, or make use of \n. There should be plenty of time to iron those things out in the Proofreading, QA/QC, and Typesetting phases of the project.

EraYaN: Between line 30 and line 31 there seems to be something missing. Or maybe the next line needs to be splitted.
