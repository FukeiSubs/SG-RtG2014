# Sakura Gakuin Translation Project - Disks
 * Sakura Gakuin - The Road to Graduation 2014 ～Kimi ni Todoke～
 * Sakura Gakuin - The Road to Graduation 2015 ～Kirameki No Kakera～

Please time all files in an absolute manner. So that the timestamps are the actual timestamps of the (full) disk.
 
Remember this repository does only really work when we all use the same editor, it seems like we will use Aegisub.
Git only works for softsubs. When we are done we can release hardsubbed video if we want, but that would be piracy. We can also just link/point to the RAWs used.

Please for any note you might need please add a Markdown (.md) file with the same name next to the ASS file.

**Please make sure the email in your client is the same as the email you used for github, or add the extra email to your github account, that way the commits will be attributed to you.**
