# Sakura Gakura Disks translation projects
 * The Road To Graduation 2014 'Kimi Ni Todoke' Subtitle Project

Remember this repository does only really work when we all use the same editor, it seems like we will use Aegisub.
Git only works for softsubs. When we are done we can release hardsubbed video if we want, but that would be piracy. We can also just link/point to the RAWs used.

Please for any note you might need please add a Markdown (.md) file with the same name next to the ASS file.
