Sakura Gakuin - The Road to Graduation 2015 ～Kirameki No Kakera～ Subtitle Project

Goals / Deadlines
-----------------

| Task         | Date |
|--------------|-----:|
| Timing       | 9/?? |
| Translation  | 9/?? |
| Proofreading | 9/?? |
| Typesetting  | 10/?? |
| Merging      | 10/?? |
| Final QA/QC  | 10/?? |
| Release      | 10/?? |

Task list
------------------------------

I have created a couple of issues for each line in the table. And used the labels `timing` and `translation` for the respective timing and translation issues.
When you start and do not finish in one go, add the `wip` label.
When you complete an issue, add the labels `needs review`. (proofreading)
The first Japanese -> English translations will be proofread and improved by preferably native English speakers. Those changes will then be checked for errors in translation or interpretation by preferably native Japanese speakers.
When you see and issue with `needs review` please do take a look and when you feel it is completely okay, close the issue. Otherwise leave a comment that you have reviewed the work.

I feel this should work loads better than the table editing in this file.

**[Here is the milestone](https://github.com/FukeiSubs/SakuraGakuin-Disks/milestone/1)**
